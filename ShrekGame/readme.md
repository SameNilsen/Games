This is a game where you control a character that shoots lazerbeams at enemies. The character designs are made by a friend of mine. It is made in Python with Arcade. It was made before i learned about OOP, so all code is in one 
single file... It is messy and complicated, but i dont care.\

When you kill an enemy it will drop an ammo pack or sometimes a health pack.
